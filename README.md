### Description ###

A local food delivery app: For the community... By the community.

Our inspiration for the app was driven by the impact of Covid-19 on both consumers and local producers alike. 

On the producer side, we noticed that local small businesses (farmers, fruit & veg suppliers, fresh food producers etc) who are heavily reliant on supplying the food service sector, have seen their incomes severely impacted by the pandemic. 

Our app provides these local businesses a platform to connect with local consumers through a food delivery service, and so help generate income during these uncertain times. 

Our app also allows local consumers  to order delicious, fresh food and produce that they would not otherwise have access to, especially during times of lockdown and self-isolation.
